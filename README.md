## Injury Prediction

iHoopInsight, the winning project of the 2024 Orange Hoops Data Science Challenge, focuses on predicting basketball player injuries. Our team designed an advanced machine learning model to compute an injury risk score for each player. By analyzing key performance metrics and muscle imbalances, the model helps identify and mitigate injury risks, empowering coaches and teams to enhance player safety and performance. Our victory was officially featured on the Syracuse University iSchool webpage, highlighting the significance of our achievement.
